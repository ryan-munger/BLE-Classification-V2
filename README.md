# BLE-Classification

This repository contains a machine learning approach to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) classification. BLE packets are classifed as malicous or benign by our model. The model utilizes a random forest clasifier as well as the packet features: ["RSSI", "Channel Index", "Company ID", "Protocol version", "Power Level (dBm)"] and is trained on attacks mostly initiated by a flipper. Key areas of interest are Bluejacking, Bluesnarfing, and Braktooth attacks. The model exhibits a 88% correct identification rate for the attacks it was trained on. For attacks it was not explicitly trained on, it correctly identifies malicous packets 63% of the time.
